# Information

## Delivery

Due to the nature of the work please allow up to 2-3 weeks for delivery. I make all of the jewellery by hand and only make to order. If you need something urgently please contact me and I will do my best to help! Email marionmillerjewellery@gmail.com

Orders are despatched by Royal Mail. Orders over £50 will be despatched by "Royal mail Special Delivery (£7.50) and orders under £50 by "Royal Mail signed for". Both require a signature on delivery.

## International Delivery

There is a delivery charge of £10 for delivery outside the UK. This is to cover the additional cost of sending by airmail and providing adequate insurance. Please look under the Bracelet tab (at the top just under the Free Uk delivery icon) to add the charge for International Delivery.

## Returns 

If you are for any reason unhappy with any product you can return the unused item within 10 days for an exchange. I regret that I cannot provide this service for any item specially commissioned. This also applies to any items made in gold.

Please insure anything being returned by sending Royal Mail "Special Delivery" as I cannot replace anything lost in transit. 

Additional postage will be charged of £7 for items over the value of £50 and £3.50 for items under the value of £50

Please keep items in original packaging.

Marion Miller Jewellery regrets that we cannot take any responsibility for any damage occurring from the incorrect wearing of a piece of our jewellery.

## How to care for your jewellery


If your jewellery becomes tarnished, use a soft, old toothbrush (definitely NO toothpaste!!!) and dip in warm soapy water and brush gently. Rinse in cold water and dry carefully. Do not use silver dip as this will remove the oxidising and can ruin the gem stones. Then polish using a Silver polishing cloth. See shop for these unless you already have one. Do not polish the oxidised parts.

For chains Silver dip can be used.

## Hallmarking

All items are sterling silver (925) unless specified otherwise. Items over the statutory weight (7.78g) are hallmarked in Edinburgh.
