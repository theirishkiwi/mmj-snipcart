## About Me

Originally from Sweden, I have lived in Scotland for 18 years.  I trained in Jewellery and Metalwork at Sir John Cass Faculty of Arts in London between 1993 and 1996. I then had my own jewellery business, “Mermaid’s Purse Jewellery”, in Ross shire on the West Coast of Scotland. After taking a break due to family commitments, I started making jewellery again.  I now live on the island of Stronsay, in Orkney, and work from my small workshop at home which overlooks the Auskerry sound and the North Sea. I have always found inspiration in the sea, shore and sky, which are constantly changing, providing me with endless design ideas.

I hope that my jewellery will inspire you to be drawn to the diverse and often dramatic maritime landscape that surrounds Orkney.

I love what I do, and hope you will love it too!



## Stronsay

The island of Stronsay is about 7 miles long and is located in the east of the Orkney archipelago.

Approximately 350 people inhabit the island and there is a junior high school with just over 30 pupils. The island is often described as being 'all arms and legs' or three-legged because of the three large bays which bite into the island. It is also very low-lying, with its highest point being Burgh Hill which is only 46 m (154 ft) above sea level. The island is very fertile and green and have several lovely sandy beaches and turquoise bays. The eastern coastline between Lamb Ness and Odiness is magnificent, with features including the famous Vat of Kirbister, a dramatic opening or 'gloup' spanned by the finest natural arch in Orkney. The cliffs are home to several seabird colonies. There are 2 ferries daily and a 8 seater plane that flies twice a day to provide transport to and from the island.
